- **Query-db.py**: Handles database connections, executes queries, and outputs results to XML files stored in the XML folder.
- **TRUONGHOC1.xlsx**: Records the execution time of specific queries (task 4), with a corresponding line chart visualizing the query times, saved as time-query.png.
- **Query-xml.py**: Allows querying of data directly from the XML files and prints the results to the console.
