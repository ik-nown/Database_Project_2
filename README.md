# Database_Project_2
This project is a database management and querying project developed for the course IT004. Itdemonstrates the ability to create, populate, query relational databases, as well as handle XML output and query optimization.

## Key components of the project include:
- **Folder Generator**: Contains Python scripts to generate and populate tables (truong, hs, hoc) in both databases.
- **Insert_function.py**: Provides six functions to insert data into the respective databases.
- **CreateSchemal.sql and CreateSchemal2.sql**: SQL scripts to create the database structures for truonghoc1 and truonghoc2, including all the required tables.
- **Query-db.py**: Handles database connections, executes queries, and outputs results to XML files stored in the XML folder.
- **TRUONGHOC1.xlsx**: Records the execution time of specific queries (task 4), with a corresponding line chart visualizing the query times, saved as time-query.png.
- **Query-xml.py**: Allows querying of data directly from the XML files and prints the results to the console.

## Tools & Technologies used 
Python, SQL, SQLite, XML, Excel, Matplotlib

## Achivements
- Successfully created and populated two relational databases, **truonghoc1** and **truonghoc2**, based on the provided schema.
- Developed Python scripts to automate table generation and data insertion for efficient database management.
- Executed complex queries on the databases, recording execution times and visualizing them through a line chart using **Matplotlib**.
- Exported query results into XML format and implemented functionality to query and print data from XML files.
- Enhanced performance analysis of database queries and demonstrated effective database querying using both SQL and XML.
